# Great-Number-Game_Python
Create a site that when a user loads it creates a random number between 1-100 
and stores the number in session.<br>
Allow the user to guess at the number and tell them when they are too high or too low.<br>
If they guess the correct number tell them you got it and show the number.<br>
